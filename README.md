FitnessGeek
============
Copyright Â© 2013 Reagan Lopez

FitnessGeek is a phone agnostic fitness app that tracks the user's activity distance, time, speed, elevation, temperature and heart rate.

This app is built using HTML5, CSS, jQueryMobile 1.3.0 and PhoneGap 2.4.0.

jQueryMobile is a unified, HTML5-based user interface system for all popular mobile device platforms, built on the jQuery and jQuery UI foundation.

PhoneGap is a web-based mobile development framework, based on the open-source Cordova project. PhoneGap allows you to use standard web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for cross-platform development, avoiding each mobile platforms' native development language. Applications execute within wrappers targeted to each platform, and rely on standards-compliant API bindings to access each device's sensors, data, and network status.

Things to add: 

1. Music player that builds a play-list based on user's social activity.
